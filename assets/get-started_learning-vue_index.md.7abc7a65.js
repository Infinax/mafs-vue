Vue is an approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.</p><p>This library was build on top of Vue for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Vue is well-documented and easy to learn</strong>. Even if you&#39;ve never used Vue, you can get up and running with Mafs quickly.</li><li><strong>Vue encourages writing declarative code</strong>. This library relies heavily on the declarative model of programming to make building a visualization feel more intuitive—just put whatever components you want on the screen, and declare what they should look like for a given state.</li><li><strong>Vue is pretty performant by default</strong>. While you can take a few steps to improve the performance of your Mafs visualization, it&#39;s usually performant enough to not think about it at all. This is largely because of abstractions built into Vue that Mafs relies on heavily—things like memoization, context, and batched updates.</li></ul><h2 id="where-to-start" tabindex="-1">Where to start <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-start" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to start&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vue&#39;s own documentation</a> is a great place to start.
